<h1 class="page__title">About Me</h1>

<p>
  My name is <b>Xiaodi Yuan</b> (袁小迪), and I also go by <b>Ada</b>. <br />

  <span style="color:gray">
    <p><b>Chinese name.</b> My name is 袁 (Yuan) 小迪 (Xiaodi) in Chinese. Xiaodi is pronounced like "see-Aw-dee", and Yuan is pronounced like "yoo-An". </p>
    <p><b>Why Ada?</b> I chose this name because (a) I know Xiaodi is hard to pronounce (and it's okay); (b) Ada is lexicographically small; (c) <code>"ada"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"xiaodi yuan"</code>; (d) actually, I named myself after world's first computer programmer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>.</p>

  I am a first-year PhD student at UC San Diego, advised by Prof. <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/">Hao Su</a>.
  I received my B.Eng. degree from <a href="https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">IIIS ("Yao Class")</a>, Tsinghua University, where I
  worked with
  Prof. <a href="https://ericyi.github.io/">Li Yi</a> on 3D shape reconstruction,
  and Prof. <a href="https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~taodu/">Tao Du</a> on physics-based simulation.
</p>

<p>My research interests are computer graphics and physics-based simulation. I am working on building fast and realistic simulation environments for embodied AI.</p>
