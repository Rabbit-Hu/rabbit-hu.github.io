collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-GelSight-TRO
excerpt: 'We build a general-purpose Sim2Real protocol for manipulation policy learning with marker-based visuotactile sensors. To improve the simulation fidelity, we employ an FEM-based physics simulator that can simulate the sensor deformation accurately and stably for arbitrary geometries. We further propose a novel tactile feature extraction network that directly processes the set of pixel coordinates of tactile sensor markers and a self-supervised pre-training strategy to improve the efficiency and generalizability of RL policies.'
